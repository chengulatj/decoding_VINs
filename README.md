# decoding_VINs
This project uses reports from the California DMV on autonomous vehicle disengagements to analyze and decode Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs). The decoded VIN information is fetched using the [NHTSA VIN Decoder Tool](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/decoder/), providing comprehensive details about the vehicle associated with the VIN.
